# AOP Network Visualizer - Features Summary

## üéØ All Requested Features Successfully Implemented

### 1. ‚úÖ Multi-Select AOP Functionality
- **Toggle Mode**: Switch between single and multi-select modes with checkbox
- **Multiple Selection**: Select multiple AOPs to view combined networks
- **Visual Feedback**: "Selected: X AOP(s)" counter shows current selection
- **Clear Function**: "Clear All" button to reset selections
- **Combined Networks**: Automatically merges nodes and edges from multiple AOPs

### 2. ‚úÖ Enhanced Path Finding with Searchable Dropdowns
- **Searchable Interface**: Type to search through all available nodes
- **Performance Optimized**: Shows first 100 nodes by default, search through all when typing
- **Keyboard Navigation**: 
  - Enter key to select first result
  - Escape key to close dropdown
- **Smart Filtering**: Search by node label, type, or ID
- **Visual Indicators**: Shows node type and ID for easy identification
- **No Limitations**: Can access all nodes in the network, not just a limited list

### 3. ‚úÖ Advanced Path Finding Algorithms
- **MIE to AO Pathfinding**: Automatically discovers pathways from Molecular Initiating Events to Adverse Outcomes
- **Dual Path Types**: 
  - **Shortest Paths**: Find most direct routes (K=1,2,3...)
  - **Longest Paths**: Discover comprehensive pathways with maximum intermediate nodes
- **Custom Source/Target**: Find paths between any two selected nodes
- **Top-K Results**: Configurable number of alternative paths to discover
- **Hypergraph Integration**: Path results automatically grouped into clean hypernodes
- **No Stressor Inclusion**: Focuses on biological pathways excluding stressor nodes
- **Context Aware**: Path finding works within selected AOP context
- **Detailed Results**: Shows path length, intermediate nodes, and edge relationships
- **Real-time Visualization**: Results immediately displayed in network/hypergraph view

### 4. ‚úÖ Node Chain Selection & Relationship-Based Selection
- **Click to Select**: Click any node to add it to the selection chain
- **Relationship Selection**: Click edges/relationships to auto-select BOTH connected nodes
- **Chain Management**: 
  - Numbered sequence showing selection order
  - Remove individual nodes from chain
  - Clear entire chain with one click
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected nodes highlighted in the interface

### 5. ‚úÖ Session-Persistent Chat Functionality
- **OpenAI Integration**: GPT-3.5-turbo for expert AOP knowledge
- **Session Persistence**: Chat state maintained across tab switches
- **Secure API Key Handling**:
  - Stored only in sessionStorage (browser session only)
  - Never persisted on servers
  - Automatically cleared when browser closes
  - Not cleared on tab switches or navigation within app
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Analyzes selected node chains and relationships
- **Expert Knowledge**: Specialized in AOP networks and toxicology

### 6. ‚úÖ Streamlined Interface (Removed External Tab)
- **Clean Design**: Removed external data panel as requested
- **Focused Tabs**: Only "Details" and "Chat" tabs remain
- **Organized Layout**: "AOP Selection & Path Finding" section clearly separated
- **No Search Section**: Removed general search, kept only path finding functionality

### 7. ‚úÖ Export & Visualization Features
- **PNG Export**: High-quality network images with üì∑ button
- **CSV Export**: Complete metadata for nodes and edges with üìä button
- **Interactive Network**: 
  - Zoom, pan, and layout controls
  - Color-coded nodes (Green triangles: MIE, Blue rectangles: KE, Pink ellipses: AO)
  - Labeled relationships showing pathway connections
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## üîß Technical Improvements

### Performance Optimizations
- **Efficient Dropdowns**: Limit display to 100 items for smooth scrolling
- **Smart Search**: Real-time filtering without lag
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of event listeners
- **Network Rendering**: Optimized graph visualization for large datasets

### User Experience Enhancements
- **Intuitive Controls**: Clear visual feedback for all interactions
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API errors and edge cases
- **Loading States**: Visual indicators during data fetching
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support

### Data Handling
- **Large Dataset Support**: Handles 1,499 nodes and 2,887 edges efficiently
- **Multi-AOP Merging**: Intelligent combination of overlapping networks
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant response to selection changes

## üåê Deployment Status
